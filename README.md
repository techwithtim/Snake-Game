# Snake-Game
The classic snake game. Made with pygame.

The game features an arcade game style in which users control a block shaped snake with their arrow keys.
The main objective is to get the snake to eat randomly populated snacks.
In return, the player's score increases. The snake also grows longer and longer, making it harder to avoid collisions and running into one's self.

# Run in Gitpod

You can also run Snake-Game in Gitpod, a free online dev environment for GitHub.
It is useful for running code from your browser rather than going through the steps of running projects locally. It is especially useful for open source contributors:
